  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}</p>

  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>Sneksoft Studios (“we”, “us”, “our”) builds VR experiences, FiveM systems and supporting web tools. This policy explains how we handle information across:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Our public website and GitHub Pages site</li>
    <li>VR content (e.g. Meta Quest / PC VR builds)</li>
    <li>FiveM servers and related tools</li>
    <li>Internal dashboards, issue trackers and automation tooling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What we do <em>not</em> do</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> use your data to build advertising profiles.</li>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect data from children under 13 (or older where local law requires).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Information we may collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Website & GitHub Pages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard HTTP logs (IP address, user agent, pages requested, timestamps)</li>
    <li>Basic analytics (e.g. page views, referrers) where enabled</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is used to keep the site secure and understand how people discover our projects.</p>

  <h3>3.2 VR apps and experiences</h3>
  <p>When you run a Sneksoft experience in VR (e.g. Meta Quest or PC VR), we may process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Platform identifiers provided by the store (e.g. Oculus / Meta account ID token or app-instance ID)</li>
    <li>Runtime telemetry: crash logs, performance data (FPS, frame timing)</li>
    <li>High-level interaction events (e.g. “level completed”, “button opened menu”) that do not need your real-world identity</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We collect this to keep the experience stable, tune performance, and understand what features actually get used.</p>

  <h3>3.3 FiveM servers and tools</h3>
  <p>When you connect to a Sneksoft-operated FiveM server or tooling stack, we typically process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identifiers supplied by Cfx / FiveM (e.g. platform IDs, license / Rockstar ID, Discord ID when linked)</li>
    <li>Server metadata (connection times, session length, resource errors)</li>
    <li>Gameplay data stored by the framework (e.g. character ID, inventory, gang membership, job role, in-server finances where applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is needed to run the server, manage characters and enforce server rules. Some data is also used for anti-cheat and abuse prevention.</p>

  <h3>3.4 Support, bug reports & feedback</h3>
  <p>If you contact us or submit feedback/bug reports (in-game, on Discord, or via email), we may receive:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your chosen display name and contact details</li>
    <li>Issue details, logs or screenshots you share</li>
    <li>Any information you voluntarily include in the message</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We only use this to reply, investigate issues and improve the project.</p>

  <h2>4. How we use your information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To provide the service</strong> – run VR builds, servers and web tools.</li>
    <li><strong>To keep things secure</strong> – detect abuse, exploits and technical issues.</li>
    <li><strong>To improve performance and UX</strong> – understand which features matter and where things break.</li>
    <li><strong>To communicate with you</strong> – answer support queries or project-related questions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal bases (where relevant)</h2>
  <p>Where privacy laws like the UK GDPR / EU GDPR apply, we typically rely on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – to provide access to the game, service or tool you requested.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – to maintain security, prevent abuse, and improve our projects in a way that respects your rights.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – when we rely on platform-level consent (e.g. platform analytics toggles) or optional features you explicitly enable.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We may share limited data with:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platform providers</strong> – e.g. Meta, Cfx / FiveM, Steam or similar, as required for platform features, moderation or analytics.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure providers</strong> – e.g. hosting, database and logging providers that help us run the services.</li>
    <li><strong>Communication tools</strong> – e.g. Discord or email providers when you talk to us there.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell your data or share it with third parties for their own advertising purposes.</p>

  <h2>7. Storage & retention</h2>
  <p>We keep information only for as long as needed to run the service, debug issues, and meet legal or platform requirements. Retention times may differ for, for example, security logs vs. routine gameplay data. Where possible, we aggregate or anonymise data over time.</p>

  <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Access: ask what data we hold about you.</li>
    <li>Correction: request fixes to inaccurate data.</li>
    <li>Deletion: ask us to delete certain information, where we are not required to keep it.</li>
    <li>Restriction or objection: in some cases, limit or object to certain types of processing.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you’d like to exercise any of these rights, contact us using the details below. We may need to verify that you are the account holder / player before acting on a request.</p>

  <h2>9. Data for Meta / Horizon / platform requirements</h2>
  <p>For VR content distributed via platforms such as Meta Quest / Horizon:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>We only access platform-provided data that is required for gameplay, platform features (like entitlements) or analytics you’ve enabled at the platform level.</li>
    <li>We follow the platform’s data-usage rules, including respecting account-level privacy settings where those apply.</li>
    <li>If the platform provides a way to request data deletion or account removal for a Sneksoft title, we will honour those requests within the time frames required by the platform.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>10. Children</h2>
  <p>Our projects are generally aimed at adults and older teens. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13, or a higher age where local law requires parental consent. If you believe a child has provided us with personal data, please contact us so we can review and, where appropriate, delete it.</p>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organisational measures appropriate to the type of data (for example access controls, monitoring and backups). No system is perfectly secure, but we work to reduce unnecessary collection and limit who can access what.</p>

  <h2>12. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Because we may use global infrastructure providers, your data may be processed in countries outside your own. Where required by law, we rely on appropriate safeguards (for example, standard contractual clauses between providers).</p>

  <h2>13. Contact</h2>
  <p>If you have questions about this policy or how we handle data in a specific Sneksoft project, you can contact us via:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/SnekSoft-Studios" target="_blank">SnekSoft-Studios</a></li>
    <li>Discord: <em>add your server / contact handle here</em></li>
    <li>Email: <em>add a contact address here</em></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>14. Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this privacy policy as projects evolve or legal requirements change. When we do, we’ll update the “Last updated” date at the top. For significant changes, we may also highlight the update in-app, on the website or via community channels.</p>
