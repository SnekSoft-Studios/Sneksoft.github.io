  <h2>1. Who we are</h2>
  <p>Sneksoft Studios (“we”, “us”, “our”) creates software, games and online tools spanning VR/XR, FiveM servers, web applications, mobile apps and internal management systems. This policy explains how we handle information across all Sneksoft products, including:</p>

    <li>Mobile applications (Android/iOS)</li>
    <li>Internal dashboards, automation and developer tooling</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>2. What we do <em>not</em> do</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data.</li>

  <h2>3. Information we may collect</h2>

  <h3>3.1 Websites & GitHub Pages</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Standard HTTP logs (IP address, user agent, pages requested, timestamps)</li>
    <li>Basic analytics (e.g. page views, referrers) where enabled</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This helps us keep sites secure and understand how visitors discover our projects.</p>

  <h3>3.2 Mobile apps (Android/iOS)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Account information you create (email, username, basic profile data)</li>
    <li>Device and OS information required for performance and debugging</li>
    <li>Push notification tokens (if you opt in)</li>
    <li>Crash reports and diagnostics</li>
    <li>App usage events that do not identify you personally</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not collect financial data, advertising identifiers, or precise location unless the app explicitly requires it and you consent.</p>

  <h3>3.3 VR / XR apps and experiences</h3>
  <p>When you use a Sneksoft VR title (Meta Quest, PC VR, standalone builds), we may process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Platform identifiers (e.g. entitlements or app-instance IDs)</li>
    <li>Crash logs, performance data (FPS, stutter frames)</li>
    <li>High-level interaction telemetry (e.g. “level completed”, “menu opened”)</li>
    <li>Controller/hand interactions where needed for gameplay</li>
    <li>Cloud save data where supported</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This helps us maintain performance, stability and feature usage analytics. We follow all Meta Horizon data usage rules.</p>

  <h3>3.4 FiveM servers and tools</h3>
  <p>When you connect to a Sneksoft-operated FiveM server or use our connected tools, we may process:</p>

    <li>Gameplay data (character ID, inventory, job, finances, gang membership)</li>
    <li>Session metadata (connection times, resource errors, anti-cheat flags)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This is necessary to run the server, maintain integrity, enforce rules, and prevent abuse or cheating.</p>

  <h3>3.5 Support, feedback & bug reports</h3>

    <li><strong>Communication</strong> – responding to support requests or user reports.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Legal bases (where relevant)</h2>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Performance of a contract</strong> – providing the app, server or service you use.</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – maintaining security, preventing abuse, improving gameplay and user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for optional features like analytics or notifications (depending on platform).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data sharing</h2>
  <p>We may share limited information with the following categories, strictly as needed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platform providers</strong> – Meta, Steam, Cfx/FiveM, Google, Apple, etc.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure providers</strong> – hosting, storage, databases, crash logging (e.g. Firebase, Cloudflare, S3).</li>
    <li><strong>Communication systems</strong> – Discord, email services, support platforms.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We do not sell data or share it for advertising or profiling.</p>

  <h2>7. Storage & retention</h2>
  <p>We keep data only for as long as required to operate the relevant service, comply with platform rules, and resolve disputes or technical issues. Where possible, we delete, anonymise or aggregate data over time.</p>

  <h2>8. Your rights</h2>
  <p>Depending on your region, you may have rights such as:</p>
  <ul>

    <li>Requesting corrections</li>
    <li>Requesting deletion (see our Data Deletion page)</li>

  <h2>11. Security</h2>
  <p>We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect data: access controls, monitoring, encrypted transport, rate limiting, and minimisation practices. No system is perfectly secure, but we work to reduce risk wherever possible.</p>

  <h2>12. International transfers</h2>
  <p>Because we use global infrastructure providers, your data may be processed in countries outside your own. When required by law, we rely on safeguards such as standard contractual clauses or equivalent protections.</p>
